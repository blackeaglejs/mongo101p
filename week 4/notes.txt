Storage Engines 
Decides what to put in memory and what to take out, which is used to optimize database design. 
Affects data file format.


Two main ones in Mongo: 
MMAP - default 
WiredTiger - bought in 2014. 

Storage Engine doesn't change API to programmer. 
There are some differences in performance. 

MMAP Storange Engine 
The way MMAP works is that it turns the database files into files in virtual memory. 
Allows collection level locking/concurrency. 
Allows in-place updating. 
We use power of two sizes - which allows you to open more space than is needed. 
Operating system makes the decision of what's in memory and what's in disk. 

WiredTiger Storage Engines 
It's faster for a lot of things. 
Does not offer locking - instead has document level concurrency.
Allows document compression and index compression.
wiredTiger cannot read files from mmap v1
